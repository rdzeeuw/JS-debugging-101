                                This exciting viol consort, consisting of 4 viola da gambas and a violone, is founded in the Spring of 2019. They are one of very few ensembles to focus 
                                mainly on 17th century consort music and are dedicated to the historical perfomance practise. Their goal is to inspire the public of today with the music 
                                of past centuries and to recreate the experience of 17th century music making and listening. The viol concort was and is music for the elite, for the living 
                                room and it reaches for intimite beauty instead of plain virtuosity.

                                    The Amstel Consort created a number of interesting programs with music from Germany, France and England, in different settings. New (or actually very old) pieces 
                                    are being discoverred, but also well known pearls are brought to life in their original form. The programs are perfect for an intimite invironment, where the audience 
                                    is sitting next to and almost in the ensemble itself. If you're interested in booking the consort for your soiree, please contact me via the contact page.

                                    Recently the Amstel Consort recorded some demo pieces, to give you a taste of the beauty that is consort music. Below you can listen to the pieces, recorded on

                                    The orchestra is being led by conducter Patrick van der Linden. During performances the orchestra involves the audience in their 
                                    musical enthousiasm. Their programs consists of music from Bach to Beethoven, but always with something new and unknown as well.
                                    Another factor for the orchestra is music education to children and adults: shows are being written especially for school audiences 
                                    and the foundation Ars Musica has a choral school for children to support their musical education. More information about their projects can be found on their <a href="http://www.stichtingarsmusica.nl">website</a>.
